I am a senior undergraduate student from [School of EECS, Peking University](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/).

Currently, I am fortunately to be advised by Prof. [Ehsan Adeli](https://stanford.edu/~eadeli/) at [Stanford Vision and Learning (SVL) Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), Prof. [Lingjie Liu](https://lingjie0206.github.io/) and Prof. [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) at [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/). I also work closely with Prof. [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li) and Prof. [Scott Delp](https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-delp).

In general, my research interests lie in computer vision, generative models, and AI for healthcare. More specifically, I’m passionate about understanding and modeling human motion, with applications in human-centric video and 3D mesh generation, biomechanics-driven analysis for healthcare, and embodied AI and robotics.
